\usage{
t_stat(x, formula, response = NULL, explanatory = NULL, order = NULL,
  alternative = "two_sided", mu = 0, conf_int = FALSE,
  conf_level = 0.95, ...)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{A data frame that can be coerced into a \link[tibble:tibble]{tibble}.}

\item{formula}{A formula with the response variable on the left and the
explanatory on the right.}

\item{response}{The variable name in \code{x} that will serve as the response.
This is alternative to using the \code{formula} argument.}

\item{explanatory}{The variable name in \code{x} that will serve as the
explanatory variable.}

\item{order}{A string vector of specifying the order in which the levels of
the explanatory variable should be ordered for subtraction, where \code{order = c("first", "second")} means \code{("first" - "second")}.}

\item{alternative}{Character string giving the direction of the alternative
hypothesis. Options are \code{"two_sided"} (default), \code{"greater"}, or \code{"less"}.}

\item{mu}{A numeric value giving the hypothesized null mean value for a one
sample test and the hypothesized difference for a two sample test.}

\item{conf_int}{A logical value for whether to include the confidence
interval or not. \code{TRUE} by default.}

\item{conf_level}{A numeric value between 0 and 1. Default value is 0.95.}

\item{...}{Pass in arguments to \{infer\} functions.}

A shortcut wrapper function to get the observed test statistic for a t test.
