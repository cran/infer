\usage{
calculate(
  x,
  stat = c("mean", "median", "sum", "sd", "prop", "count", "diff in means",
    "diff in medians", "diff in props", "Chisq", "F", "slope", "correlation", "t", "z"),
  order = NULL,
  ...
)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{The output from \code{\link[=generate]{generate()}} for computation-based inference or the
output from \code{\link[=hypothesize]{hypothesize()}} piped in to here for theory-based inference.}

\item{stat}{A string giving the type of the statistic to calculate. Current
options include \code{"mean"}, \code{"median"}, \code{"sum"}, \code{"sd"}, \code{"prop"}, \code{"count"},
\code{"diff in means"}, \code{"diff in medians"}, \code{"diff in props"}, \code{"Chisq"},
\code{"F"}, \code{"t"}, \code{"z"}, \code{"slope"}, and \code{"correlation"}.}

\item{order}{A string vector of specifying the order in which the levels of
the explanatory variable should be ordered for subtraction, where \code{order = c("first", "second")} means \code{("first" - "second")} Needed for inference on
difference in means, medians, or proportions and t and z statistics.}

\item{...}{To pass options like \code{na.rm = TRUE} into functions like
\link[base:mean]{mean()}, \link[stats:sd]{sd()}, etc.}
}
\value{
A tibble containing a \code{stat} column of calculated statistics.
}
\description{
\Sexpr[results=rd, stage=render]{lifecycle::badge("maturing")}

Calculates summary statistics from outputs of \code{\link[=generate]{generate()}} or
\code{\link[=hypothesize]{hypothesize()}}.
